    Related issue: #3
    Integers have to be represented as text tokens, because
    any leading '0' will get erased by the integer representation.
    Integer are then `read` in the parser.

    Incorrect error:

 [error]: Parse error on input
      In: test/error_movToInteger.nst

  9| mov %0123, %rax
          ^ unrecognized register '123'

 Registers are fixed depending on the target architecture.
 Registers available in different architectures are documented here:
